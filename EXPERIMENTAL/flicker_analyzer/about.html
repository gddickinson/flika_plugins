Automated Flicker/Transient Event Detector using temporal signal analysis. Detects Ca2+ flickers, PIEZO1 activity transients, and brief intensity events WITHOUT requiring ROI placement or puncta detection. Uses pixel-wise temporal analysis with multiple detection methods (z-score, derivative, wavelet, variance) to automatically identify when and where transient events occur. Outputs flicker frequency maps, amplitude maps, temporal raster plots, duration/amplitude distributions, and comprehensive statistics. Perfect for analyzing Ca2+ flickers, mechanotransduction events, and spontaneous cellular activity. Designed for the Medha Pathak Lab at UCI.
