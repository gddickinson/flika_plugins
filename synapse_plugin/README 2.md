# SynapseAnalysis
Synapse Activity Program based on BioDocks Library

INTRODUCTION
------------
The Synapse Analysis program takes as input the coordinates of synapse activity through two channels of light, and displays each channel as red or green.  Base colors are stored in the code itself for easy manipulation.  The user may draw ROIs around clusters of points to analyze the mean XY distance, area, and count of points in the active region.


REQUIREMENTS
------------
Reliant on Python 3.4 or 2.7 (untested), preferably installed through Anaconda Scientific Library (http://continuum.io/downloads#py34) as well as several other python plugins:

Included in Anaconda:
*	PyQt 		v4	(will not install with 'pip')
*	numpy 	v1.9.2
*	scipy 	v0.16
*	scikit-learn	v0.16.1
*	xlrd		v0.9.3

Separate installs:
*	pyqtgraph	v0.9.10
*	biodocks	v0.7

To install plugins, open a command prompt and type 'pip install plugin-name', using the names as they appear above.

INSTALLATION
------------
To install the SynapseAnalysis Program, install all of the plugins listed above into your python environment, download the SynapseAnalysis Folder from github (https://github.com/BrettJSettle/SynapseAnalysis) by clicking on the 'Download Zip' button on the right sidebar. Extract it to your computer and run by clicking the 'run.bat' file located inside the SynapseAnalysis Folder
