Advanced Flicker and Transient Event Detector for automated detection and characterization of Ca2+ flickers, PIEZO1-mediated calcium signals, and other rapid intensity transients in TIRF microscopy. Designed for the Medha Pathak Lab at UCI. Features four detection algorithms (threshold, derivative, z-score, wavelet), comprehensive event characterization (amplitude, duration, rise/decay kinetics, ΔF/F₀), temporal pattern analysis, ROI and regional comparisons, raster plots, and complete data export. Perfect for analyzing Ca2+ flicker dynamics, PIEZO1 localization and activity, mechanotransduction signaling, and correlation with cell behaviors.
