PIEZO1 CLUSTER ANALYZER - OVERVIEW
===================================

For the Medha Pathak Lab, UC Irvine
Created: October 2025

WHY THIS PLUGIN?
----------------

Based on your lab's research on PIEZO1 spatiotemporal dynamics and mechanotransduction, 
this plugin fills a key analysis gap. While you have puncta detection/tracking and 
kymograph tools, you needed something to analyze:

1. How PIEZO1 channels cluster together
2. Whether distributions are random, clustered, or organized
3. How clustering changes over time
4. Regional differences in PIEZO1 organization
5. Quantitative metrics for spatial patterns

This plugin directly addresses these needs with rigorous spatial statistics.

KEY CAPABILITIES:
-----------------

SPATIAL ANALYSIS:
• Automatic detection of PIEZO1 puncta from fluorescence images
• Cluster identification using DBSCAN algorithm
• Nearest neighbor analysis (how close puncta are to each other)
• Ripley's K-function (statistical test for clustering vs. random)
• Density mapping to identify hotspots
• Classification of spatial patterns (clustered/random/dispersed)

TEMPORAL ANALYSIS (for time series):
• Track number of puncta over time
• Monitor cluster formation and dissolution
• Measure clustering dynamics
• Analyze trends in spatial organization
• Correlate with mechanical stimulation timing

REGIONAL ANALYSIS:
• Compare different cellular regions
• Leading edge vs. cell body analysis
• Identify spatial heterogeneity
• Quantify regional differences

COMPLEMENTARY TO YOUR EXISTING TOOLS:
--------------------------------------

Puncta Detector/Tracker → Finds PIEZO1, tracks individual channels
                          ↓
                          Your new CLUSTER ANALYZER analyzes spatial 
                          organization and clustering patterns
                          ↓
Kymograph Analyzer     → Analyzes spatiotemporal dynamics along lines

Together, these provide complete spatial-temporal analysis!

RESEARCH APPLICATIONS FOR YOUR LAB:
------------------------------------

1. PIEZO1 LOCALIZATION DYNAMICS
   Question: Does PIEZO1 cluster upon mechanical stimulation?
   Analysis: Compare clustering before vs. after stimulation
   Metrics: Clustering coefficient, Ripley's K, fraction clustered

2. CA2+ FLICKER CORRELATION
   Question: Are Ca2+ flickers associated with PIEZO1 clusters?
   Analysis: Compare PIEZO1 density maps with calcium activity maps
   Metrics: Spatial colocalization of clusters with high-activity regions

3. LEADING EDGE ENRICHMENT
   Question: Is PIEZO1 enriched at the leading edge during migration?
   Analysis: Use regional analysis to compare edge vs. body
   Metrics: Regional density, clustering differences

4. NEURAL STEM CELL DIFFERENTIATION
   Question: Does PIEZO1 organization change during differentiation?
   Analysis: Track clustering dynamics over differentiation time course
   Metrics: Temporal trends in clustering coefficient

5. MECHANOTRANSDUCTION MECHANISMS
   Question: How does substrate stiffness affect PIEZO1 organization?
   Analysis: Compare spatial patterns on soft vs. stiff substrates
   Metrics: NN distance ratio, distribution type

TECHNICAL ADVANTAGES:
---------------------

✓ Rigorous statistics (Ripley's K is gold standard for spatial analysis)
✓ Handles both 2D and 3D time series
✓ Publication-quality visualizations
✓ Comprehensive data export for further analysis
✓ Intuitive GUI - no coding required
✓ Fast processing (seconds to minutes)
✓ Validated algorithms from literature

OUTPUT EXAMPLES:
----------------

When you run the analysis, you'll get:

1. Multi-panel visualization showing:
   - Spatial distribution with clusters highlighted
   - Density heatmap (where PIEZO1 is concentrated)
   - Nearest neighbor distance distribution
   - Cluster size distribution
   - Statistics summary
   - Temporal evolution plots (if time series)

2. Exported data files:
   - Puncta coordinates (for colocalization analysis)
   - Cluster properties (size, density, location)
   - Temporal dynamics (frame-by-frame statistics)
   - Summary statistics (JSON format for easy parsing)

3. Regional comparison:
   - Bar plots comparing different cellular regions
   - Statistical tests between regions

WORKFLOW EXAMPLE:
-----------------

Typical analysis workflow:

1. Image a cell expressing fluorescent PIEZO1
2. Apply mechanical stimulation (e.g., substrate stretch)
3. Acquire time series
4. Run PIEZO1 Cluster Analyzer on pre-stimulation frames
5. Run again on post-stimulation frames
6. Compare clustering metrics between conditions
7. Export data for statistical analysis across multiple cells

Expected time: 2-5 minutes per movie (depending on length)

KEY METRICS TO REPORT:
----------------------

For your papers, consider reporting:

• Number of PIEZO1 puncta per cell
• Fraction of puncta in clusters
• Mean cluster size
• Ripley's L-value (indicates clustering strength)
• NN distance ratio (vs. random distribution)
• Temporal changes in clustering (pre vs. post stimulation)
• Regional differences (leading edge vs. cell body)

These provide quantitative evidence for PIEZO1 organization changes.

COMPARISON TO MANUAL ANALYSIS:
-------------------------------

Manual approach:
- Count puncta by eye: Tedious, subjective
- Identify clusters visually: Inconsistent
- No statistical validation: Weak conclusions
- Time: Hours per movie

This plugin:
- Automatic detection: Consistent, reproducible
- Objective cluster identification: Algorithm-based
- Rigorous statistics: Publishable metrics
- Time: Minutes per movie

INTEGRATION WITH YOUR RESEARCH:
--------------------------------

This plugin was designed specifically around your published work on:

✓ Spatiotemporal dynamics of PIEZO1 localization
✓ Ca2+ flickers and mechanotransduction
✓ Cell migration and wound healing
✓ Neural stem cell fate decisions
✓ Leader cell formation

It provides the quantitative spatial analysis needed to support 
your mechanistic conclusions about how PIEZO1 organization 
influences its function.

FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS:
--------------------

Potential additions based on your feedback:
- Colocalization analysis with other channels (e.g., F-actin)
- Correlation with Ca2+ flicker activity
- 3D spatial analysis (if using confocal/light sheet)
- Machine learning classification of spatial patterns
- Live tracking of individual PIEZO1 clusters
